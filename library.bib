abstract = {Evidence that face perception is mediated by special cognitive and neural mechanisms comes from fMRI studies of the fusiform face area (FFA) and behavioral studies of the face inversion effect. Here, we used these two methods to ask whether face perception mechanisms are stimulus specific, process specific, or both. Subjects discriminated pairs of upright or inverted faces or house stimuli that differed in either the spatial distance among parts (configuration) or the shape of the parts. The FFA showed a much higher response to faces than to houses, but no preference for the configuration task over the part task. Similarly, the behavioral inversion effect was as large in the part task as the configuration task for faces, but absent in both part and configuration tasks for houses. These findings indicate that face perception mechanisms are not process specific for parts or configuration but are domain specific for face stimuli per se.},

abstract = {Neuroimaging (PET and fMRI) studies have identified a set of brain areas responding more to faces than to other object categories in the visual extrastriate cortex of humans. This network includes the middle lateral fusiform gyrus (the fusiform face area, or FFA) as well as the inferior occipital gyrus (occipital face area, OFA). The exact functions of these areas in face processing remain unclear although it has been argued that their primary function is to distinguish faces from nonface object categories - "face detection" - or also to discriminate among faces, irrespective of their visual familiarity to the observer. Here, we combined the data from two previous positron emission tomography (PET) studies to show that the functionally defined face areas are involved in the automatic discrimination between unfamiliar faces and familiar faces. Consistent with previous studies, a face localizer contrast (faces-objects) revealed bilateral activation in the middle lateral fusiform gyrus (FFA, BA37) and in the right inferior occipital cortex (OFA, BA19). Within all the regions of the right hemisphere, larger levels of activation were found for unfamiliar as compared to familiar faces. These results suggest that the very same areas involved in categorizing faces at the basic or individual level, play a role in differentiating familiar faces from new faces, showing an overlap between visual and presemantic mnesic representations of faces in the right hemisphere. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

abstract = {Face recognition across different viewing conditions is strongly improved by familiarity. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the neural basis of this effect is a less view-dependent representation of familiar faces in ventral visual cortex by assessing priming-related fMRI repetition effects. 15 healthy volunteers made male/female judgements on familiar (famous) and unfamiliar (novel) faces preceded by the same image, a different image of the same face, or another (unprimed) face. Reaction times revealed priming by same and different images independent of familiarity and more pronounced for same than different images. In the imaging data, a main effect of prime condition was found in bilateral fusiform and orbitofrontal regions. A right anterior fusiform region expressed stronger response decreases to repetition of familiar than unfamiliar faces. Bilateral mid-fusiform areas showed stronger response decreases to repetition of same than different images. A regions-of-interest analysis focussing specifically on face responsive regions suggested differences in the degree of image dependency across fusiform cortex. Collapsing across familiarity, there was greater image dependency of repetition effects in right than left anterior fusiform, replicating previous imaging findings obtained with common objects. For familiar faces alone, there was greater generalisation of repetition effects over different images in anterior than middle fusiform. This suggests a role of anterior fusiform cortex in coding image-independent representations of familiar faces. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Twelve normal subjects viewed alternating sequences of unfamiliar faces, unpronounceable nonword letterstrings, and textures while echoplanar functional magnetic resonance images were acquired in seven slices extending from the posterior margin of the splenium to near the occipital pole. These stimuli were chosen to elicit initial category-specific processing in extrastriate cortex while minimizing semantic processing. Overall, faces evoked more activation than did letterstrings. Comparing hemispheres, faces evoked greater activation in the right than the left hemisphere, whereas letterstrings evoked greater activation in the left than the right hemisphere. Faces primarily activated the fusiform gyrus bilaterally, and also activated the right occipitotemporal and inferior occipital sulci and a region of lateral cortex centered in the middle temporal gyrus. Letterstrings primarily activated the left occipitotemporal and inferior occipital sulci. Textures primarily activated portions of the collateral sulcus. In the left hemisphere, 9 of the 12 subjects showed a characteristic pattern in which faces activated a discrete region of the lateral fusiform gyrus, whereas letterstrings activated a nearby region of cortex within the occipitotemporal and inferior occipital sulci. These results suggest that different regions of ventral extrastriate cortex are specialized for processing the perceptual features of faces and letterstrings, and that these regions are intermediate between earlier processing in striate and peristriate cortex, and later lexical, semantic, and associative processing in downstream cortical regions.},

@article{Dien2009,
abstract = {Two areas of current intense interest in the neuroimaging literature are that of the visual word form area (VWFA) and of the fusiform face area (FFA) and their roles in word and face perception, respectively. These two areas are of particular relevance to laterality research because visual word identification and face identification have long been shown to be especially lateralized to the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere, respectively. This review therefore seeks to evaluate their significance for the broader understanding of lateralization of object recognition. A multi-level model of lateralized object recognition is proposed based on a combination of behavioral and neuroimaging findings. Rather than seek to characterize hemispheric asymmetries according to a single principle (e.g., serial-parallel), it is suggested that current observations can be understood in terms of three asymmetric levels of processing, using the framework of the Janus model of hemispheric function. It is suggested that the left hemisphere represents features using an abstract-category code whereas the RH utilizes a specific-exemplar code. The relationships between these features are also coded asymmetrically, with the LH relying on associative co-occurrence values and the RH relying on spatial metrics. Finally, the LH controlled selection system focuses on isolating features and the RH focuses on conjoining features. It is suggested that each hemisphere utilizes efficient (apparently parallel) processing when stimuli are congruent with its preferred processing style and inefficient (apparently serial) processing when they are not, resulting in the typical left-lateralization for orthographic analysis and right-lateralization for face analysis. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A growing body of evidence suggests that a different hemispheric specialization may exist for different modalities of person identification, with a prevalent right lateralization of the sensory-motor systems allowing face and voice recognition and a prevalent left lateralization of the name recognition system. Data supporting this claim concern, however, much more disorders of familiar people recognition observed in patients with focal brain lesions than results of experimental studies conducted in normal subjects. These last data are sparse and in part controversial, but are important from the theoretical point of view, because it is not clear if hemispheric asymmetries in the recognition of faces, voices and names are limited to their perceptual processing, or also extend to the domain of their cortical representations. The present review has tried to clarify this issues, taking into account investigations that have evaluated in normal subjects laterality effects in recognition of familiar names, faces and voices, by means of behavioural, neurophysiological and neuroimaging techniques. Results of this survey indicate that: (a) recognition of familiar faces and voices show a prevalent right lateralization, whereas recognition of familiar names is lateralized to the left hemisphere; (b) the right hemisphere prevalence is greater in tasks involving familiar than unfamiliar faces and voices, and the left hemisphere superiority is greater in the recognition of familiar than unfamiliar names. Taken together, these data suggest that hemispheric asymmetries in the recognition of faces, voices and names are not limited to their perceptual processing, but also extend to the domain of their cortical representations. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Tootell1995,
abstract = {Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we found an area in the fusiform gyrus in 12 of the 15 subjects tested that was significantly more active when the subjects viewed faces than when they viewed assorted common objects. This face activation was used to define a specific region of interest individually for each subject, within which several new tests of face specificity were run. In each of five subjects tested, the predefined candidate “face area” also responded significantly more strongly to passive viewing of (1) intact than scrambled two-tone faces, (2) full front-view face photos than front-view photos of houses, and (in a different set of five subjects) (3) three-quarter-view face photos (with hair concealed) than photos of human hands; it also responded more strongly during (4) a consecutive matching task performed on three-quarter-view faces versus hands. Our technique of running multiple tests applied to the same region defined functionally within individual subjects provides a solution to two common problems in functional imaging: (1) the requirement to correct for multiple statistical comparisons and (2) the inevitable ambiguity in the interpretation of any study in which only two or three conditions are compared. Our data allow us to reject alternative accounts of the function of the fusiform face area (area “FF”) that appeal to visual attention, subordinate-level classification, or general processing of any animate or human forms, demonstrating that this region is selectively involved in the perception of faces.},

Sensitivity to 3 transformations increased with expertise: (a) configural changes in which halves of objects were misaligned, (b) configural changes in which some of the object parts were moved, and (c) the substitution of an object part with a part from a different object. The authors found that holistic-configural effects can arise from object representations that are differentiated in terms of features or parts. Moreover, a holistic-inclusive effect was correlated with changes in the right FFA.

@article{Sergent1992,
abstract = {Studies of brain-damaged patients have revealed the existence of a selective impairment of face processing, prosopagnosia, resulting from lesions at different loci in the occipital and temporal lobes. The results of such studies have led to the identification of several cortical areas underlying the processing of faces, but it remains unclear what functional aspects of face processing are served by these areas and whether they are uniquely devoted to the processing of faces. The present study addresses these questions in a positron emission tomography (PET) study of regional cerebral blood flow in normal adults, using the 15oxygen water bolus technique. The subjects participated in six tasks (with gratings, faces and objects), and the resulting level of cerebral activation was mapped on images of the subjects' cerebral structures obtained through magnetic resonance and was compared between tasks using the subtraction method. Compared with a fixation condition, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes were found in the striate and extrastriate cortex when subjects had to decide on the orientation of sine-wave gratings. A face-gender categorization resulted in activation changes in the right extrastriate cortex, and a face-identity condition produced additional activation of the fusiform gyrus and anterior temporal cortex of both hemispheres, and of the right parahippocampal gyrus and adjacent areas. Cerebral activation during an object-recognition task occurred essentially in the left occipito-temporal cortex and did not involve the right hemisphere regions specifically activated during the face-identity task. The results provide the first empirical evidence from normal subjects regarding the crucial role of the ventro-medial region of the right hemisphere in face recognition, and they offer new information about the dissociation between face and object processing.},

abstract = {The left-hemisphere dominance for language is a core example of the functional specialization of the cerebral hemispheres. The degree of left-hemisphere dominance for language depends on hand prefer-ence: Whereas the majority of right-handers show left-hemispheric language lateralization, this number is reduced in left-handers. Here, we assessed whether handedness analogously has an influence upon lateralization in the visual system. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we localized 4 more or less specialized extrastriate areas in left-and right-handers, namely fusiform face area (FFA), extrastriate body area (EBA), fusiform body area (FBA), and human motion area (human middle temporal [hMT]). We found that lateralization of FFA and EBA depends on handedness: These areas were right lateralized in right-handers but not in left-handers. A similar tendency was observed in FBA but not in hMT. We conclude that the relationship between handedness and hemispheric lateral-ization extends to functionally lateralized parts of visual cortex, indicating a general coupling between cerebral lateralization and handedness. Our findings indicate that hemispheric specialization is not fixed but can vary considerably across individuals even in areas engaged relatively early in the visual system.},

abstract = {Face perception, perhaps the most highly developed visual skill in humans, is mediated by a distributed neural system in humans that is comprised of multiple, bilateral regions. We propose a model for the organization of this system that emphasizes a distinction between the representation of invariant and changeable aspects of faces. The representation of invariant aspects of faces underlies the recognition of individuals, whereas the representation of changeable aspects of faces, such as eye gaze, expression, and lip movement, underlies the perception of information that facilitates social communication. The model is also hierarchical insofar as it is divided into a core system and an extended system. The core system is comprised of occipitotemporal regions in extrastriate visual cortex that mediate the visual analysis of faces. In the core system, the representation of invariant aspects is mediated more by the face-responsive region in the fusiform gyrus, whereas the representation of changeable aspects is mediated more by the face-responsive region in the superior temporal sulcus. The extended system is comprised of regions from neural systems for other cognitive functions that can be recruited to act in concert with the regions in the core system to extract meaning from faces.},

abstract = {EEG studies suggested that the N170 ERP and Gamma-band responses to faces reflect early and later stages of a multiple-level face-perception mechanism, respectively. However, these conclusions should be considered cautiously because EEG-recorded Gamma may be contaminated by noncephalic activity such as microsaccades. Moreover, EEG studies of Gamma cannot easily reveal its intracranial sources. Here we recorded MEG rather than EEG, assessed the sources of the M170 and Gamma oscillations using beamformer, and explored the sensitivity of these neural manifestations to global, featural and configural information in faces. The M170 was larger in response to faces and face components than in response to watches. Scrambling the configuration of the inner components of the face even if presented without the face contour reduced and delayed the M170. The amplitude of MEG Gamma oscillations (30-70 Hz) was higher than baseline during an epoch between 230-570 ms from stimulus onset and was particularly sensitive to the configuration of the stimuli, regardless of their category. However, in the lower part of this frequency range (30-40 Hz) only physiognomic stimuli elevated the MEG above baseline. Both the M170 and Gamma were generated in a posterior-ventral network including the fusiform, inferior-occipital and lingual gyri, all in the right hemisphere. The generation of Gamma involved additional sources in the visual system, bilaterally. We suggest that the evoked M170 manifests a face-perception mechanism based on the global characteristics of face, whereas the induced Gamma oscillations are associated with the integration of visual input into a pre-existent coherent perceptual representation.},

Although it has been commonly assumed that the right hemispheric dominance for face processing underlies this left-visual-field superiority in face recognition, this neural-behavioral association has never been directly demonstrated. Here we applied functional MRI (fMRI) to measure the magnitude of the asymmetric response to faces for each subject. To determine whether the asymmetric neural response to faces is stable across sessions, subjects returned for a second fMRI session. In addition, subjects performed a behavioral experiment outside the scanner where they had to recognize centrally presented chimeric faces, which presented different identities in the right- and left-visual-field. This task yielded a measure of the magnitude of the left-visual-field bias for each subject. Our findings show that the magnitude of the asymmetry of the face-selective area in the fusiform gyrus (FFA) is highly consistent for each individual across scans. We then show that the behavioral left-visual-field asymmetry, measured outside the scanner, was strongly and specifically correlated with the asymmetry of the FFA across subjects, but not with other face-specific or nearby object-general regions. Our findings provide the first empirical evidence for the prevalent idea that perceptual asymmetries in face recognition are associated with the well-known hemispheric asymmetry for faces. We conclude that the FFA asymmetry is a highly stable individual characteristic that underlies the well-established left-visual-field superiority for face recognition. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {"Organismic achievement may extend in two main directions; (1) specificity regarding certain stimulus variables as antecedents or causes of reactions, and (2) specificity regarding certain results of organismic reaction." The probability character of the causal relationships in the environment demands a fundamental, all-inclusive shift in methodological ideology regarding psychology. If psychology wishes to deal with vitally relevant molar aspects of adjustment and achievement, it must become statistical throughout. Traditional statistical treatment is inadequate. The viewpoints of Lewin, Hull, and others are examined and their limitations noted. To establish the methodological unity of science, it will become increasingly important to emphasize thematic differences. There can be no truly molar psychology unless it gives up the nomothetic ideal in favor of a thoroughly statistical conception.},

The authors' describe the cognitive interview, a questioning process they developed and tested for police use. Drawing largely on cognitive psychology, the authors propose a method of interviewing that they believe helps witnesses remember salient facts of crime. Among other concepts, the authors discuss the interactive nature of interviewing, major factors that limit recall, the logistics of interviewing, the wording and pacing of questions, and methods for probing memory. Although this volume includes some background regarding memory, cognitive science, and the research and testing that led to this interviewing technique, the focus of the book is on the practical description and application of the method. The final chapters provide a transcript of two interviews complete with commentary by the authors regarding questions and responses, as well as a chapter about training investigators in the cognitive interview method.

The first attitude is called maximizing behavior, and it is founded on a set of assumptions that are unattainable in real-world decision making. The use of this attitude invariably results in a failed strategic decision. The second managerial attitude is called satisficing behavior, and its use is demonstrably conducive to strategic decision success.

abstract = {In this age of e-business, there is an increasing over-reliance on electronic communication and insufficient attention paid to the management of face-to-face relationships. In this fascinating text, John Hayes addresses this significant workplace issue by examining the nature of interpersonal skill: the goal-directed behaviours used in face-to-face interactions in order to achieve desired outcomes. He argues that interpersonal competence is a key managerial skill which can distinguish the successful from the unsuccessful. Providing a clearly structured and comprehensive overview of the interpersonal skills essential for effective functioning at work, this book presents a micro-skills approach to development that can be used to improve interpersonal competence, as well as explaining, through the use of illustrations and practical examples, how to read the actual or potential behaviour of those around us. This knowledge can then be used to guide the way in which we relate to others as we learn to manage our relationships more effectively. This book will be ideal for practising managers and students of business and management studies and psychology. The skills it promotes make it of great value for those in a wide range of professions (including teachers, doctors, nurses, social workers and police officers) in their everyday working environment.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on the role of specific outcome expectancies in self-regulation. It is observed that specific expectancies are commonly found to be optimistic. The results from studies of specific expectations provide considerable substance to Lewin's paradox that the key to effective self-regulation of behavior and well-being involves the interplay of optimistic expectations and the demands of reality. It is also noted that optimistic expectations can sometimes be disconfirmed. People deal with these disconfirmations by using any of the variety of mechanisms for maintaining optimistic beliefs even in the face of their disconfirmation. Through the combination of relative and strategic optimism and strategies for minimizing the potentially adverse effects of disconfirmations of optimistic expectations, people are able to simultaneously meet the self-regulatory needs to extract meaningful information from their environment and to maintain a positive sense of self. The chapter considers expectancies from different domains and integrates results from a wide variety of empirical paradigms.},

Measures included the Beck Depression Inventory and the Attributional Style Questionnaire. Increasing depression was associated with depressive pessimism and with certainty in making pessimistic predictions in Study 1. Such certainty was associated with depression, even when perceived likelihood of events and generalized hopelessness were considered. In Study 2, depressive predictive certainty was associated with depression, even when negative life events and attributional style were included in the equation. The interaction between attributional style and negative life events was positively associated with depression and with depressive predictive certainty.

abstract = {Experimental manipulations of affect induced by a brief newspaper report of a tragic event produced a pervasive increase in subjects' estimates of the frequency of many risks and other undesirable events. Contrary to expectation, the effect was independent of the similarity between the report arid the estimated risk. An account of a fatal stabbing did not increase the frequency estimate of a closely related risk, homicide, more than the estimates of unrelated risks such as natural hazards. An account of a happy event that created positive affect produced a comparable global decrease in judged frequency of risks. As a society, we have never been more con-cerned with the assessment, the management, and the regulation of risk. Because public reaction to hazards from pesticides, nuclear power, or food additives appears to influence the regulation and management of these tech-nologies, it is important to understand how the lay person perceives and evaluates risks. This is particularly true for hazards such as terrorism, nuclear power, or genetic engi-neering for which the available statistical data are very limited and where the assessments of the risks are based on subjective and in-tuitive judgments. Indeed, psychologists and other researchers have shown increasing interest in the manner in which people perceive and estimate the severity of various risks. Lichtenstein, Slovic, Fischhoff, Layman, and Combs (1978) asked lay people to estimate the number of deaths per year that are due to various hazards. These investigators found that the subjective estimates were consistent across several methods of elicitation and correlated reason-ably well (median r = .7) with actuarial es-timates of frequency.

Although the 1978 reformulation has generated a vast amount of empirical work on depression over the past 10 years and recently has been evaluated as a model of depression, we do not think that it presents a clearly articulated theory of depression. We build on the skeletal logic of the 1978 statement and (a) propose a hypothesized subtype of depression—hopelessness depression, (b) introduce hopelessness as a proximal sufficient cause of the symptoms of hopelessness depression, (c) deemphasize causal attributions because inferred negative consequences and inferred negative characteristics about the self are also postulated to contribute to the formation of hopelessness and, in turn, the symptoms of hopelessness depression, and (d) clarify the diathesis—stress and causal mediation components implied, but not explicitly articulated, in the 1978 statement. We report promising findings for the hopelessness theory and outline the aspects that still need to be tested. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved)},

In Experiments 1A and 1B, participants prescribed more optimism for someone implementing decisions than for someone deliberating, indicating that people prescribe optimism selectively, when it can affect performance. Furthermore, participants believed optimism improved outcomes when a person's actions had considerable, rather than little, influence over the outcome (Experiment 2). Experiments 3 and 4 tested the accuracy of this belief; optimism improved persistence, but it did not improve performance as much as participants expected. Experiments 5A and 5B found that participants overestimated the relationship between optimism and performance even when their focus was not on optimism exclusively. In summary, people prescribe optimism when they believe it has the opportunity to improve the chance of success-unfortunately, people may be overly optimistic about just how much optimism can do.

The structure of scripts is simple and intuitive. As a result, new experiments can be written very quickly, and trying to understand a previously written script is easy, even with minimal code comments.

abstract = {Anxious and depressed humans typically view circumstances more pessimistically than non-depressed individuals. Here, we explore the proposal that such cognitive biases also exist in non-human animals, and could be used as novel measures of animal welfare. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that wild-caught captive European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) are more optimistic in their interpretation of ambiguous stimuli when they are housed in cages designed to promote greater welfare compared with when they are housed in standard laboratory cages. Starlings were trained using a choice procedure to discriminate between two temporal stimuli (2 s versus 10 s duration light stimulus) associated with outcomes of a different value (instant or delayed food). Next, the birds' responses to ambiguous, unreinforced stimuli of intermediate duration ranging from 2 to 10 s were examined under two housing regimes designed to manipulate the birds' welfare: big enriched cages versus standard cages (smaller and unenriched). The birds' probability of classifying an intermediate stimulus as that associated with the instant food outcome was significantly higher in the enriched cage compared with the standard cage. Thus, the birds displayed greater optimism in the face of uncertainty under housing conditions in which other measures indicate better welfare. These findings support the use of cognitive bias-based tasks as a novel, non-invasive technique for assessing affective state in non-human animals. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Received academic wisdom holds that human judgment is characterized by unrealistic optimism, the tendency to underestimate the likelihood of negative events and overestimate the likelihood of positive events. With recent questions being raised over the degree to which the majority of this research genuinely demonstrates optimism, attention to possible mechanisms generating such a bias becomes ever more important. New studies have now claimed that unrealistic optimism emerges as a result of biased belief updating with distinctive neural correlates in the brain. On a behavioral level, these studies suggest that, for negative events, desirable information is incorporated into personal risk estimates to a greater degree than undesirable information (resulting in a more optimistic outlook). However, using task analyses, simulations, and experiments we demonstrate that this pattern of results is a statistical artifact. In contrast with previous work, we examined participants??? use of new information with reference to the normative, Bayesian standard. Simulations reveal the fundamental difficulties that would need to be overcome by any robust test of optimistic updating. No such test presently exists, so that the best one can presently do is perform analyses with a number of techniques, all of which have important weaknesses. Applying these analyses to five experiments shows no evidence of optimistic updating. These results clarify the difficulties involved in studying human ???bias??? and cast additional doubt over the status of optimism as a fundamental characteristic of healthy cognition.},

We measured both absolute and comparative risk perceptions, and also used the Gail algorithm to assess the accuracy of participants' risk perceptions. Three hundred and one women ages 40-75 participated in a two-part study assessing how format of breast cancer risk presentation affected perceptions of risk. Relative to their Gail scores, women were biased pessimistically about their own absolute breast cancer risk and yet largely accurate about their comparative breast cancer risk. Perceived comparative risk, but not perceived absolute risk or biases in absolute or comparative risk, predicted subsequent worry. Worry predicted subsequent perceived absolute risk and biases in absolute and comparative risk. These results suggest that women's emotional reactions to breast cancer risk are based on accurate (unbiased) perceptions of their comparative risks. In turn, greater worry prompts a re-evaluation of absolute risk as well as changes in risk biases. Implications for screening are discussed.

abstract = {Five studies showed that people assess vulnerability to future controllable negative life events differently depending on whether it concerns: (a) generalized targets (e.g., the average peer), or (b) concrete and familiar targets (self or nonself). In the former case, adistributionalframework is applied which focuses on available statistical information such as groups' base-rates. In the latter case, people apply asingularjudgmental perspective and focus on available individuating information such as personal dispositions and preventive actions. This perspective would typically lead to an optimistic bias in favor of concrete and familiar rather than generalized targets. Participants in Study 1 evaluated both self's and a spontaneously selected (non-intimate) peer's risk prospects as lower than those of their average peer in controllable but not uncontrollable future events or controllable and uncontrollable everyday negative events. Study 2 replicated the main findings in direct comparative judgments. In Study 3, verbal accounts and a measure of interest in the base-rate supported the singular-distributional analysis. In Studies 4 and 5, an optimistic bias was found in favor of a randomly assigned member of their small group to whom participants were yoked. These findings suggest that in addition to the classic “illusion of unique invulnerability” (e.g., Perloff {\&} Fetzer, 1986), whereby participants judge themselves to be less vulnerable than the average group-member, there is an “illusion ofnonuniqueinvulnerability,” whereby participants judge also their singular group-members to be less vulnerable than the average group-member. Finally we discuss conditions in which apessimisticrather than the standard optimistic bias might occur in comparative risk comparisons.},

According to an egocentric-processes account, when people judge their com-parative likelihood of experiencing an event (e.g., “Compared to the average person, how likely are you to become wealthy?”), they consider their own chances of experiencing the event more so than the referent's chances. This should produce higher comparative estimates when an event's absolute frequency is high rather than low—a prediction supported in Study 1, which manipulated event frequency through a novel, time frame manipulation. Study 2 empirically distinguished egocentrism from a related focalism account. In Study 3, comparative estimates were related to the perceived frequency of events, independent of the events' perceived desirability and controllability. Path analyses provided additional support for egocentrism, and systematic cases of comparative pessimism were observed as predicted by the egocentric-process...},

We investigated whether WT is grounded on low-level selective attention or on higher level cognitive processes including differential weighting of evidence or response formation. Participants in our MRI study predicted the likelihood that their favorite or least favorite team would win a football game. Consistent with expectations, favorite team trials were characterized by higher winning odds. Our data demonstrated activity in a cluster comprising parts of the left inferior occipital and fusiform gyri to distinguish between favorite and least favorite team trials. More importantly, functional connectivities of this cluster with the human reward system were specifically involved in the type of WT investigated in our study, thus supporting the idea of an attention bias generating WT. Prefrontal cortex activity also distinguished between the two teams. However, activity in this region and its functional connectivities with the human reward system were altogether unrelated to the degree of WT reflected in the participants' behavior and may rather be related to social identification, ensuring the affective context necessary for WT to arise.},

In Study 1, participants completed brief measures of religiosity and spirituality and attitudes toward religiously value-consistent in-groups (Christians, heterosexuals) and value-violating out-groups (atheists, Muslims, and gay men). As predicted, selfreported religiosity and spirituality correlated positively with more negative attitudes toward out-groups relative to in-groups. In Study 2, priming methods were used to examine whether activating cognitive representations of religion would affect intergroup bias. Individuals subliminally primed with religious words showed significantly larger increases in negative attitudes toward value-violating out-groups relative to attitudes toward in-groups than those primed with neutral words. This change in relative attitudes was due to simultaneous increases in in-group favoritism and outgroup derogation. These effects remained when statistically controlling for selfreported religiosity and spirituality and preexisting attitudes toward these groups. Furthermore, there were no interaction effects between religious primes and selfreported levels of religiosity, indicating that the religion primes drove the effects. Results are discussed in light of religious priming and its association with increases in attitudes relevant to the social group component of religion.},

abstract = {The cognitive theories of depression emphasize the role of pessimism about the future in the etiology and maintenance of depression. The present research was designed for two reasons: to provide a clear demonstration that depressed individuals' predictions of the likelihood of future outcomes are more pessimistic than those of nondepressed individuals given identical information with which to make forecasts and identical conditions for forecasting, and to test two additional hypotheses regarding possible mechanisms underlying depressives' relative pessimism in forecasting: a social-comparison and a differential attributional-style hypothesis. We used a modification of the cue-use paradigm developed by Ajzen (1977, Experiment 1) and examined depressed and nondepressed people's predictions of the likelihood of future positive and negative outcomes for themselves and for others. The results provided strong support for pessimism on the part of depressed individuals relative to nondepressed individuals in forecasts for both self and others. In addition, whereas nondepressives exhibited a self-enhancing bias in which they overestimated their probability of success and underestimated their probability of failure relative to that of similar others, depressives did not succumb to either positive or negative social comparison biases in prediction. Finally, in line with the attributional-style hypothesis, depressed-nondepressed differences in subjects' cue-use patterns were obtained, especially in forecasts for self. The findings are discussed with respect to the mechanisms underlying predictive optimism and pessimism and the possible functions and implications of these predictive biases.},

Seventy British adults completed measures of identity motives, British identification and positive and negative trait typicality ratings of British and German nationalities. With greater identification, the strength of motives for distinctiveness and belonging increasingly predicted in-group favouritism: consistent with optimal distinctiveness theory, the belonging motive predicted positive ratings of the national in-group, whereas the distinctiveness motive predicted negative ratings of the national out-group.

abstract = {People tend to overestimate their comparative likelihood of experiencing a rosy future. The present research suggests that one reason for this error is that when people compare their likelihood of experiencing an event with that of the average person, they focus on their own chances of experiencing the event and insufficiently consider the likelihood of the average person experiencing the event. As a consequence, people tend to think that they are more likely than the average person to experience common events and less likely than the average person to experience rare events. This causes unrealistic optimism in the case of common desirable events and rare undesirable events, but unrealistic pessimism in the case of rare desirable events and common undesirable events (Studies 1 and 2). Study 2 further suggests that both egocentrism and focalism underlie these biases. These results suggest that unrealistic optimism is not as ubiquitous as once thought. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Modesty with strangers and self-enhancement with friends both resulted in impaired recall for the interaction, consistent with the view that those strategies contradict familiar, overlearned patterns.

Both groups of Ss displayed overconfidence, that is, they overestimated the likelihood that their predictions would prove to be accurate. Of key importance, depressed Ss were less accurate in their predictions, and thus more overconfident, than their nondepressed counterparts. These differences arose because depressed Ss (a) were more likely to predict the occurrence of low base-rate events and (b) were less likely to be correct when they made optimistic predictions (i.e., stated that positive events would occur or that aversive outcomes would not). Discussion focuses on implications of these findings for the depressive realism hypothesis.},

The paper discusses significant developments in the research on these issues, describes specific studies that represent trends in this research, and discusses methodologic issues important to the development of the field. Although there are relatively few studies that demonstrate causal links between risk communication and behavior change, recent developments in the field point to the importance of tailoring risk communications to the individual characteristics of targets. Such tailoring has taken a variety of forms, including providing individualized feedback concerning risk status or genetic vulnerability and assessing readiness for behavior change. Future intervention efforts should combine individualized risk status feedback with assessment of individual differences in previous behavior and acceptance of personal vulnerability.},

Positive mood affects target risk estimates. Finally, moderators that surround the comparison process appear to have different effects. Specifically, the type ofcomparison target appears to affect target risk estimates, whereas attention to personal risk-related behaviors affects personal risk estimates.},

abstract = {Two studies addressed parallel questions about the correlates and consequences of self-enhancement bias. Study 1 was conducted in a laboratory context and examined self-enhancing evaluations of performance in a group-interaction task. Study 2 assessed students' illusory beliefs about their academic ability when they first entered college and then followed them longitudinally to test claims about the long-term benefits of positive illusions. Both studies showed that self-enhancement bias was related to narcissism, ego involvement, self-serving attributions, and positive affect. Study 2 found that self-enhancement was associated with decreasing levels of self-esteem and well-being as well as with increasing disengagement from the academic context. Self-enhancement did not predict higher academic performance or higher graduate rates. Thus, the findings suggest that self-enhancing beliefs may be adaptive in the short term but not in the long term.},

Each of these communication variables initiates corresponding cognitive appraisal processes that mediate attitude change. The proposed conceptualization is a special case of a more comprehensive theoretical schema: expectancy-value theories. Several suggestions are offered for reinterpreting existing data, designing new types of empirical research, and making future studies more comparable. Finally, the principal advantages of protection motivation theory over the rival formulations of Janis and Leventhal are discussed.},

abstract = {Research indicates that a positive relationship generally exists between dispositional optimism and goal engagement and attainment. The authors argue, however, that dispositional optimism may not always be associated with more active goal pursuit. Rather, they hypothesized that this relationship is moderated by how highly a goal is prioritized. For high-priority goals, they predicted that optimistic individuals would indeed increase goal engagement and would be more likely to attain their goal relative to individuals low in optimism. For low-priority goals, they anticipated that optimistic individuals would not display greater goal engagement or attainment. In 5 studies they assessed these predictions across a variety of domains, including friendship formation, exercise persistence, and scholastic achievement. Results supported their contention that goal priority acts as a moderator of the relationship between dispositional optimism and both goal engagement and goal attainment. Evidence of 1 mediator of this moderation effect-behavioral intentions-and of a limiting factor-the temporal ordering of goals-is also presented.},

This study employed a 2 (optimism/no optimism) ?? 2 (pain/no pain) between-subjects design to explore whether (1) experimentally induced pain (cold pressor task) deteriorates subsequent executive task performance, and (2) whether an optimism induction can counteract this sustained deteriorating effect of pain on executive task performance. Results indicated that although pain led to significantly worse performance on the executive functioning task in the no optimism condition, this sustained deteriorating effect of pain on task performance was abolished in the optimism condition. This finding is imperative because it suggests that optimism may be an important factor to implement in current psychological treatment approaches to diminish the negative impact of chronic pain on the ability to function in daily life. ?? 2013 International Association for the Study of Pain.

This approach is applied to two tasks that experts are often required to perform in the context of forecasting and in the service of decision making: the prediction of values and the assessment of credible intervals. The analysis of these judgements reveals two major biases: nonregressiveness of predictions and overconfidence. Both biases are traced to people's tendency to give insufficient weight to certain types of information, for example, the base-rate frequency of outcomes and their predictability. The corrective procedures described in this paper are designed to elicit from the expert relevant information that he would normally neglect and to help him integrate this information with his intuitive impressions in a manner that respects basic principles of statistical prediction.},

Furthermore, optimism has costs after feedback-participants who predicted higher scores before feedback felt worse after learning their scores. Finally, people seem to be aware of the potential costs of optimism-participants who predicted higher scores before feedback also anticipated experiencing greater disappointment should they perform poorly.

abstract = {It is proposed that satisfaction is associated with idealistic, rather than realistic, perceptions of one's partner. To provide baselines for assessing relationship illusions, both members of married and dat-ing heterosexual couples were asked to rate themselves and their partners on a variety of interper-sonal attributes. Participants also rated the typical and ideal partner on these attributes. Path analy-ses revealed that individuals' impressions of their partners were more a mirror of their self-images and ideals than a reflection of their partners' self-reported attributes. Overall, intimates saw their partners in a more positive light than their partners saw themselves. Furthermore, these idealized constructions predicted greater satisfaction. Individuals were happier in their relationships when they idealized their partners and their partners idealized them. Taken together, these results suggest that a certain degree of idealization or illusion may be a critical feature of satisfying dating and even marital relationships. In the case of love, realities model themselves enthusiastically on one's desires. . . it is the passion in which violent desire is most completely satisfied. (Beyle Stendhal, De L'Amour) As Stendhal's musings in De L'Amour illustrate, people im-mersed in the experience of romantic love often appear to bend reality to the will of their hopes and desires. Rather than being constrained by the sometimes-disappointing reality of their partners' actual attributes, individuals may view their partners through the rosy niters provided by images of ideal partners. Within such idealized constructions, intimates may even see virtues in one another's apparent faults. For example, individu-als may preserve feelings of confidence in their romantic rela-tionships—in the face of the doubts posed by a partner's fail-ings—by weaving stories that depict such faults in the best pos-sible light (Murray {\&} Holmes, 1993,1994).},

Our survey data of 224 university students provides support for the moderation of self-efficacy and chance-efficacy.

abstract = {If unrealistic optimism is simply a manifestation of the illusion of control (McKenna, 1993), differences in estimates of the likelihood of events for the self and others (comparative optimism) should have concomitant differences in perceived capacity to control these events. This possibility was tested in the domain of health, along with Perloff {\&} Fetzer's (1986) risk-factor version of this downward comparison hypothesis and the hitherto neglected possibility that unrealistic optimism is an artifact of the comparative procedures employed in studies to date. It was found that likelihood judgements for a range of illnesses tended to be significantly lower when made by subjects providing self-ratings than when made by those providing judgements for the 'typical' student and, to a lesser extent, those making judgements for a friend's friend, but not by those doing so for an acquaintance. This comparative optimism was associated with equivalent differences in perceptions of these targets on a selection of relevant risk factors, but not in ratings of their capacity to control these outcomes (for which there was consensus across targets). The data are thus consistent with the risk-factor version of the hypothesis rather than the control version or the artifact explanation. The theoretical implications of these findings are addressed along with their consequences for health promotion.},

Unrealistic optimism can be operationalized in multiple ways; is commonplace yet has well-established boundary conditions; occurs for a variety of reasons; and has consequences for affect, decision making, and behavior.},

abstract = {Although some optimists may be accurate in their positive beliefs about the future, others may be unrealistic-their optimism is misplaced. Research shows that some smokers exhibit unrealistic optimism by underestimating their relative chances of experiencing disease. An important question is whether such unrealistic optimism is associated with risk-related attitudes and behavior. We addressed this question by investigating if one's perceived risk of developing lung cancer, over and above one's objective risk, predicted acceptance of myths and other beliefs about smoking. Hierarchical regressions showed that those individuals who were unrealistically optimistic (i.e., whose perceived risk was less than their objective risk) were more likely to endorse beliefs that there is no risk of lung cancer if one only smokes for a few years and that getting lung cancer depends on one's genes. Unrealistic optimists were also more likely to believe that a greater number of lung cancer patients are cured, but they were less likely to identify smoking cessation/avoidance as a way to reduce cancer risk. Most importantly, unrealistic optimists were less likely to plan on quitting smoking. Taken together, these data suggest that in the smoking arena, unrealistic optimism is a potentially costly cognitive strategy.},

abstract = {Does desire for an outcome inflate optimism? Previous experiments have produced mixed results regarding the desirability bias, with the bulk of supportive findings coming from one paradigm-the classic marked-card paradigm in which people make discrete predictions about desirable or undesirable cards being drawn from decks. We introduce a biased-guessing account for the effects from this paradigm, which posits that people are often realistic in their likelihood assessments, but when making a subjectively arbitrary prediction (a guess), they will tend to guess in a desired direction. In order to establish the validity of the biased-guessing account and to distinguish it from other accounts, we conducted five experiments that tested the desirability bias within the paradigm and novel extensions of it. In addition to supporting the biased-guessing account, the findings illustrate the critical role of moderators (e.g., type of outcome, type of forecast) for fully understanding and predicting desirability biases. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Members of a health maintenance organization (N=353) interacted with a computer program that provided personalized information about their risk of developing colon cancer in the next 20 years. Prior to computer feedback, most people greatly overestimated their numerical, absolute risk (chances per 1000) and also overestimated their relative risk compared to peers (e.g., "above average"). Their relative risk estimates were correlated with several risk factors, whereas their absolute risk estimates were not, suggesting that assessing individual risk perceptions with numerical, absolute risk scales may provide misleading information about what people believe. Computer feedback improved the accuracy of mean risk estimates, but about half of participants did not accept the personalized feedback as correct. In fact, correlations between actual and perceived risk were no greater among participants who received risk scores than among those who did not. Three possible explanations for resistance to lower-than-expected risk feedback are considered.},

Drawing from a recent review of the literature, we describe how both optimism and shifts from optimism serve the common goal of preparedness, which includes a readiness to deal with setbacks and a readiness to take advantage of opportunities. Shifts from optimism occur in response to available information and to the possibility that things may not turn out as hoped. People tend to shift from optimism when feedback is anticipated in the near future, when the outcome is important, when negative outcomes are easily imagined, and when the outcomes are uncontrollable. In addition, people with low self-esteem shift from optimism more readily than do people with high self-esteem. Finally, both optimism and shifts from optimism have unique benefits in terms of preparedness.},

Women who had higher objective risk of breast cancer, as defined by the Gail et al. algorithm (M. H. Gail et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst., 81: 1879-1886, 1989), were more likely to perceive themselves at greater subjective risk for breast cancer. Among the components of objective risk, family history of breast cancer was the only significant predictor of subjective risk. Both objective and subjective risk individually predicted stages of change, such that higher objective and subjective risk were associated with an increased probability of being in a later stage of adopting mammography. However, when objective and subjective risk were included in a multivariate model, only subjective risk predicted stages of change. In additional multivariate analyses, subjective risk continued to predict mammography stages of change when "con" and "decisional balance" scores were included in separate models. These results suggest that future research may benefit from the explicit integration of personal risk perceptions with elements of the Transtheoretical Model to provide more powerful accounts of behavioral change processes.},

The structure of scripts is simple and intuitive. As a result, new experiments can be written very quickly, and trying to understand a previously written script is easy, even with minimal code comments. PsychoPy can also generate movies and image sequences to be used in demos or simulated neuroscience experiments.

abstract = {Fugitive species often live under harsh physical conditions, yet their ability to cope with environmental extremes has received little attention. We studied the asso- ciation of fugitive plants and stressful physical conditions using salt marsh plants that live in hypersaline bare patches. In New England salt marshes, primary space is dominated by dense monospecific stands of perennial turfs, but disturbances frequently leave bare space that rapidly becomes hy- persaline. Elevated salinities of bare patches result from direct exposure of soil to solar radiation and evaporative water loss. A number of fugitive plants that are rare in undisturbed salt marsh vegetation are commonly associated with bare patches before being displaced during secondary succession. Greenhouse studies show that plants that dominate undisturbed vegetation are stunted by high substrate salinities, whereas the photosynthesis and growth of patch-dependent fu- gitives are relatively independent of typical salinity variation. Moreover, in the field, watering more than doubled the survivorship and growth of seedlings in patches and more strongly affected dominants than patch-dependent fugitives. Our results show that physical conditions in salt marsh bare patches can limit plant colonization, and suggest that high salt tolerances may permit fugitive plants to utilize bare patches as refugia from competitors. Since fugitive plants are commonly restricted to physically stressful habitats, the ability to withstand harsh physical conditions is likely often an important aspect of their biology},

We tested the influence of age on optimistic and pessimistic beliefs about the future and the associated structural neural correlates.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: Eighteen young and 18 healthy older adults performed a belief updating paradigm, measuring differences in updating beliefs for desirable and undesirable information about future negative events. These measures were related to regional brain volume, focusing on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) because this region is strongly linked to a positivity bias in older age.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We demonstrate an age-related reduction in updating beliefs when older adults are faced with undesirable, but not desirable, information about negative events. This greater 'update bias' in older age persisted even after controlling for a variety of variables including subjective rating scales and poorer overall memory. A structural brain correlate of this greater 'update bias' was evident in greater grey matter volume in the dorsal ACC in older but not in young adults.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We show a greater update bias in healthy older age. The link between this bias and relative volume of the ACC suggests a shared mechanism with an age-related positivity bias. Older adults frequently have to make important decisions relating to personal, health and financial issues. Our findings have wider behavioural implications in these contexts because an enhanced optimistic update bias may skew such real-world decision making.},

abstract = {In this article, we review evidence that people are more positive in assessments of specific individuals than they are about collectives of others, even when people have essentially no information about the individual or collective they are judging. We offer three explanations for this difference. First, evaluative “attacks” on individuals are more aversive than similar attacks on collectives. Second, to encourage or smooth interaction, people sometimes “assume the best” about individuals until proven wrong. Social interaction occurs between specific individuals, so such optimism does not extend to people in general. Third, in making judgments of individuals versus collectives, people naturally focus on different types of information. For an individual, people spontaneously consider influences that operate inside an individual (e.g., one's will, one's moral conscience). But for collectives, people instead contemplate influences that operate at a social level (e.g., social influence, social norms). We explore how these three proposals help predict when judgments of individuals and collectives do or do not differ.},

Our research indicates that people underestimate their completion times. Further, people appear to base their estimates on plan-based, future scenarios and they use attributional mechanisms to deny the relevance of their past failures to complete tasks on time. The optimistic bias disappears when observers forecast the completion times of other individuals (actors). Observers' estimates are no more accurate, however; instead observers exhibit a pessimistic bias, overestimatingactors' task completion times. Compared to actors, observers make greater use of relevant previous experiences in generating their predictions; also while proposing future scenarios, observers are more likely to mention cir- cumstancesthat might impede the actor's progress on the task.

The study included 146 middle-age adults who reported heart attack-related knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors and read an essay about heart attack risk factors. Dispositional optimism was correlated with comparative optimism (perception of low risk relative to peers) but not with a variable assessing accuracy of participants' comparative risk estimates (unrealistic optimism). Individuals high in dispositional optimism and comparative optimism possessed an adaptive risk and belief profile and knew more about heart attacks, whereas unrealistically optimistic individuals exhibited the opposite pattern and also learned relatively less of the essay material. Evidently, perceptions of low comparative risk are relatively accurate, dispositional optimism is associated in an adaptive way with information processing, and unrealistic optimism may be associated with processing deficits and defensiveness, as well as higher risk.},

@article{Moutsiana2015,
abstract = {UNLABELLED How humans integrate information to form beliefs about reality is a question that has engaged scientists for centuries, yet the biological system supporting this process is not well understood. One of the most salient attributes of information is valence. Whether a piece of news is good or bad is critical in determining whether it will alter our beliefs. Here, we reveal a frontal-subcortical circuit in the left hemisphere that is simultaneously associated with enhanced integration of favorable information into beliefs and impaired integration of unfavorable information. Specifically, for favorable information, stronger white matter connectivity within this system, particularly between the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and left subcortical regions (including the amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, putamen, and pallidum), as well as insular cortex, is associated with greater change in belief. However, for unfavorable information, stronger connectivity within this system, particularly between the left IFG and left pallidum, putamen, and insular cortex, is associated with reduced change in beliefs. These novel results are consistent with models suggesting that partially separable processes govern learning from favorable and unfavorable information. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Beliefs of what may happen in the future are important, because they guide decisions and actions. Here, we illuminate how structural brain connectivity is related to the generation of subjective beliefs. We focus on how the valence of information is related to people's tendency to alter their beliefs. By quantifying the extent to which participants update their beliefs in response to desirable and undesirable information and relating those measures to the strength of white matter connectivity using diffusion tensor imaging, we characterize a left frontal-subcortical system that is associated simultaneously with greater belief updating in response to favorable information and reduced belief updating in response to unfavorable information. This neural architecture may allow valence to be incorporated into belief updating.},

This should produce higher comparative estimates when an event's absolute frequency is high rather than low-a prediction supported in Study 1, which manipulated event frequency through a novel, time frame manipulation. Study 2 empirically distinguished egocentrism from a related focalism account. In Study 3, comparative estimates were related to the perceived frequency of events, independent of the events' perceived desirability and controllability. Path analyses provided additional support for egocentrism, and systematic cases of comparative pessimism were observed as predicted by the egocentric-processes account.},

Our results reveal that unbiased belief updating in depression is mediated by strong neural coding of estimation errors in response to both good news (in left inferior frontal gyrus and bilateral superior frontal gyrus) and bad news (in right inferior parietal lobule and right inferior frontal gyrus) regarding the future. In contrast, intact mental health was linked to a relatively attenuated neural coding of bad news about the future. These findings identify a neural substrate mediating the breakdown of biased updating in major depression disorder, which may be essential for mental health.},

@article{Wood1985,
abstract = {We investigated four theoretical perspectives concerning the role of social comparison (Festinger, 1954) in coping with a threatening event in a sample of breast cancer patients. According to the supercoper perspective, personal contact with comparison others is often unavailable to patients, and contact with media "supercopers"— fellow victims presented as adjusting very smoothly—may make patients feel in-adequate by comparison. According to the similarity perspective, patients select comparison targets who are similar to themselves because those comparisons should be the most informative. The upward comparison perspective is predictive of com-parisons to relatively advantaged or superior individuals. The downward comparison perspective leads to the prediction that under conditions of threat, individuals make comparisons to people who are inferior or less fortunate in order to enhance their self-esteem. We interviewed 78 breast cancer patients, and results of both closed-ended questions and spontaneously offered comparisons yielded a preponderance of downward comparisons. The results point to the value of using naturalistic meth-ods for studying comparisons, and suggest a more active and cognitive role for social comparison than is usually portrayed. Nearly all persons are confronted with se-rious illness in their lifetimes, either by be-coming ill themselves or by being faced with the illness of someone they love. The difficulties wrought by serious illness include pain and disability, disruption of one's life style, intense fears, and strains in close relationships (Cohen This article is based on the first author's doctoral dis-sertation, which was submitted to the University of Cali-fornia, Los Angeles (UCLA).

abstract = {Objectives. Taylor {\&} Gollwitzer (1995) suggested that optimistic biases about risk are not an impediment to precaution adoption. Their ‘mindset hypothesis' proposes that such biases are suspended during deliberation over new behaviours and reappear only later during thoughts about implementing these behaviours. This paper examines the research on which the mindset hypothesis was based and presents new data on this issue from an experiment designed to encourage home radon testing (Weinstein, Lyon, Sandman {\&} Cuite, 1998). Method. Homeowners (N = 1346) in an area of high radon risk watched either a ‘risk' video that gave information about the need to test, a ‘how to test' video that focused on the implementation of testing decisions, or both. Risk perception biases were assessed before and after viewing the videos and purchases of radon test kits were determined. Results. No support was found for the mindset-illusions predictions. In contrast, the data indicated that optimistic biases about personal risk are barriers to action. Conclusion. There are several methodological problems in the design used to support the mindset-illusions hypothesis. In contrast to this hypothesis, it appears that acceptance of personal vulnerability is an important aspect of progress toward precaution adoption. The adaptiveness of optimistic biases about risk is also discussed.},

abstract = {This study examined the relationship between depressive symptoms and bias in the prediction of future life events. Responding to internet announcements, 153 participants varying widely in self-reported depression symptom severity estimated the probability of 40 events occurring over the succeeding 30 days. After the 30-day period, participants reported which events occurred. Optimistic/pessimistic biases were related to level of depressive symptoms. A non-significant optimistic bias characterized participants with low depressive symptoms whereas a significant pessimistic bias characterized participants with high depressive symptoms. Those reporting mild symptoms did not exhibit a systematic pessimistic or optimistic bias. General imprecision in predictions for undesirable events was associated with depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that depression is associated with pessimistic bias rather than accuracy in judgment.},

Both the historical basis of the field and a broad selection of current work are summarized. Reinforcement learning is the problem faced by an agent that learns behavior through trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic environment. The work described here has a resemblance to work in psychology, but differs considerably in the details and in the use of the word ``reinforcement.'' The paper discusses central issues of reinforcement learning, including trading off exploration and exploitation, establishing the foundations of the field via Markov decision theory, learning from delayed reinforcement, constructing empirical models to accelerate learning, making use of generalization and hierarchy, and coping with hidden state. It concludes with a survey of some implemented systems and an assessment of the practical utility of current methods for reinforcement learning.},

abstract = {Discusses the occurrence of unrealistic optimism about the risk of experiencing negative events. The difficulty of determining the actual risk and the difficulty in understanding and providing risk probabilities hinder the assessment of unrealistic optimism. This can be avoided by looking for bias on a group level and by studying comparative rather than absolute risk estimates. The most prominent determinant of such optimism is motivated distortions which protect self-esteem, project a positive social image, or reduce anxiety. The causes of optimistic biases can be understood through a study of negative events that elicit different amounts of bias and the discovery of attributes responsible for these differences. Another approach is to focus on the correlations between personal attributes and optimism. Unrealistic optimism can be altered by various interventions.},

abstract = {Objective: Dispositional optimism has been associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular mortality, but the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. We therefore studied whether dispositional optimism was associated with healthy lifestyle and dietary habits. Methods: In 773 (87.1{\%}) of 887 Dutch elderly community-living men with complete data in 1985, the associations of dispositional optimism with lifestyle and dietary factors were assessed at baseline and during follow-up every 5 years up to 15 years using multilevel regression models. Measurements: Dispositional optimism was assessed using a four-item questionnaire, and the participants' food consumption was assessed by a cross-check dietary history method that estimates the usual food consumption pattern of the participants. Lifestyle factors were assessed by questionnaires, while weight and height were measured to calculate body mass index. Results: A high level of dispositional optimism was associated with more physical activity (P{\textless}.001), nonsmoking (P=.02), and higher intakes of alcohol (P=.046), fruit (P=.01), vegetables (P=.01), and whole-grain bread (P=.01), independently from age, education, living arrangement, self-rated health, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer, and body mass index, as well as total energy intake (for dietary factors). Conclusion: Dispositional optimism in elderly men is associated with healthy lifestyle and dietary habits. A low level of optimism may indirectly affect proneness to cardiovascular death via unhealthy behavioral choices. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Humans hold unrealistically optimistic predictions of what their future holds. These predictions are generated and maintained as people update their beliefs more readily when receiving information that calls for adjustment in an optimistic direction relative to information that calls for adjustment in a pessimistic direction. Thus far this update bias has been shown when people make estimations regarding the self. Here, we examine whether asymmetric belief updating also exists when making estimations regarding population base rates. We reveal that while participants update beliefs regarding risk in the population in an asymmetric manner, such valence-dependent updating of base rates can be accounted for by priors. In contrast, we show that optimistic updating regarding the self is a robust phenomenon, which holds even under different empirical definitions of desirable information.},

abstract = {In each of two experiments, college students were assigned to two ad hoc groups (Team A and Team B) that competed in a dart-throwing contest. On each trial, one contestant from each team threw a single dart at a standard dart board, trying to come as close as possible to hitting the bull's-eye. Also on each trial, the other participants judged the likelihood that both the Team A contestant and the Team B contestant would come closer to hitting the bull's-eye. In both experiments (N = 36 in Experiment 1; N = 35 in Experiment 2), participants exhibited a strong wishful thinking effect. They judged the likelihood that their own team members would come closer to be greater than the likelihood that the opposing team members would come closer. Experiment 2 suggested that it was participants' desires, as opposed to some other variable associated with team membership, that influenced their predictions. Experiment 2 also showed that the size of the effect did not depend on whether participants believed that their predictions had been influenced by their team membership. These results help bridge the gap between previous experimental laboratory studies, which have produced inconsistent results, and correlational field studies of sports fans and voters, which have consistently produced large effects.

abstract = {Daniel Kahneman (2011) posits two main processes that characterize thinking: "System 1" is a fast decision making system responsible for intuitive decision making based on emotions, vivid imagery, and associative memory. "System 2" is a slow system that observes System 1's outputs, and intervenes when "intuition" is insufficient. Such an intervention occurs "when an event is detected that violates the model of the world that System 1 maintains" (Kahneman, 2011, p. 24). Here, we propose specific underlying mechanisms for Kahneman's Systems 1 and 2, in terms of the LIDA model, a broad, systems-level, cognitive architecture (Franklin et al., 2014). LIDA postulates that human cognition consists of a continuing, overlapping iteration of cognitive cycles, each a cognitive "atom," out of which higher-order processes are built. In LIDA terms, System 1 employs consciously mediated action selection in which a stimulus is acted upon within one or two cognitive cycles. In contrast, System 2, which LIDA posits to operate according to James' ideomotor theory (James, 1950), requires more cognitive cycles in its deliberative decision making. Thus, we suggest that System 2 employs multiple occurrences of System 1 in its operation. To test the proposed mechanisms, we perform an in silico experiment using a LIDA-based software agent.},

We therefore studied whether dispositional optimism was associated with healthy lifestyle and dietary habits. Methods: In 773 (87.1{\%}) of 887 Dutch elderly community-living men with complete data in 1985, the associations of dispositional optimism with lifestyle and dietary factors were assessed at baseline and during follow-up every 5 years up to 15 years using multilevel regression models.

Men who knew they were seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were significantly more optimistic about not developing AIDS than men who knew they were seronegative for HIV. This AIDS-specific optimism was related to higher perceived control over AIDS and to active coping among seropositive men only and to health behaviors in both serostatus groups. There was no relation of optimism to risk-related sexual behavior. It is concluded that optimism is psychologically adaptive without necessarily compromising health behavior. It is also concluded that it is useful to distinguish between event-based optimistic expectations and dispositional optimism.},

abstract = {Anxious and depressed humans typically view circumstances more pessimistically than non-depressed individuals. Here, we explore the proposal that such cognitive biases also exist in non-human animals, and could be used as novel measures of animal welfare. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that wild-caught captive European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) are more optimistic in their interpretation of ambiguous stimuli when they are housed in cages designed to promote greater welfare compared with when they are housed in standard laboratory cages. Starlings were trained using a choice procedure to discriminate between two temporal stimuli (2 s versus 10 s duration light stimulus) associated with outcomes of a different value (instant or delayed food). Next, the birds' responses to ambiguous, unreinforced stimuli of intermediate duration ranging from 2 to 10 s were examined under two housing regimes designed to manipulate the birds' welfare: big enriched cages versus standard cages (smaller and unenriched). The birds' probability of classifying an intermediate stimulus as that associated with the instant food outcome was significantly higher in the enriched cage compared with the standard cage. Thus, the birds displayed greater optimism in the face of uncertainty under housing conditions in which other measures indicate better welfare. These findings support the use of cognitive bias-based tasks as a novel, non-invasive technique for assessing affective state in non-human animals. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast to this adaptive behavior, anxious, fearful, and phobic individuals show exaggerated attention biases to threat. In addition, they overestimate the likelihood of encountering their feared stimulus and the severity of the consequences; both are examples of expectancy biases. The co-occurrence of attention and expectancy biases in fear and anxiety raises the question about causal influences. Herein, we summarize findings related to expectancy biases in fear and anxiety, and their association with attention biases. We suggest that evidence calls for more comprehensive research strategies in the investigation of mutual influences between expectancy and attention biases, as well as their combined effects on fear and anxiety. Moreover, both types of bias need to be related to other types of distorted information processing commonly observed in fear and anxiety (e.g., memory and interpretation biases). Finally, we propose new research directions that may be worth considering in developing more effective treatments for anxiety disorders.},

More importantly, the findings provided support for self-efficacy expectancy as a fourth component of protection motivation theory: Self-efficacy had a direct influence on intentions and interacted with two other variables of protection motivation theory. The interaction effect was interpreted in terms of two new decision-making strategies that people use when confronted with a fear appeal: a precaution strategy and a hyperdefensiveness strategy.

abstract = {BACKGROUND When challenged with information about the future, healthy participants show an optimistically biased updating pattern, taking desirable information more into account than undesirable information. However, it is unknown how patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD), who express pervasive pessimistic beliefs, update their beliefs when receiving information about their future. Here we tested whether an optimistically biased information processing pattern found in healthy individuals is absent in MDD patients. METHOD MDD patients (n = 18; 13 medicated; eight with co-morbid anxiety disorder) and healthy controls (n = 19) estimated their personal probability of experiencing 70 adverse life events. After each estimate participants were presented with the average probability of the event occurring to a person living in the same sociocultural environment. This information could be desirable (i.e. average probability better than expected) or undesirable (i.e. average probability worse than expected). To assess how desirable versus undesirable information influenced beliefs, participants estimated their personal probability of experiencing the 70 events a second time. RESULTS Healthy controls showed an optimistic bias in updating, that is they changed their beliefs more toward desirable versus undesirable information. Overall, this optimistic bias was absent in MDD patients. Symptom severity correlated with biased updating: more severely depressed individuals showed a more pessimistic updating pattern. Furthermore, MDD patients estimated the probability of experiencing adverse life events as higher than healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS Our findings raise the intriguing possibility that optimistically biased updating of expectations about one's personal future is associated with mental health.},

We argue that judgments of our risk for health and safety problems are shaped by social comparisons, and we consider the implications of this statement for the construction of successful health campaigns. /// We ask 4 questions. Do various elements of the social comparison process influence personal risk judgments? Do people attempt to preserve their favorable comparative standing on risk dimensions? Do social comparisons with others occur spontaneously when making judgments about personal risk in everyday life? Do people's social comparisons on risk dimensions predict their affective, self-evaluative, and behavioral responses? To answer these questions, we draw heavily from a body of research whose consistent message is that when people estimate their risk relative to that of others, they often are unrealistically optimistic. /// Our examination of these issues also allows us to address 2 related topics--how research on risk judgment may contribute to the development of social comparison theory, and how research linking social comparison with risk judgments may suggest ways of increasing desirable health behaviors and decreasing undesirable behaviors.

abstract = {We sought to identify and correct inaccurate perceptions of risk among 1,317 adult patients in a primary care setting. Patients' perceived risks of heart attack, stroke, cancer, and motor vehicle crash were assessed and compared with a measure of risk derived from a health risk appraisal. Patients were then randomly assigned to receive computer-generated individualized risk feedback, risk feedback plus behavioral change feedback, or no feedback. Changes in perceived risk from baseline to a 6-month follow-up were compared across study groups. Results showed that individualized risk feedback was effective in increasing perceived stroke risk among patients who had underestimated their stroke risk at baseline and in reducing perceived risk of cancer among patients who had overestimated their cancer risk at baseline. Individualized risk feedback did not alter patients' perception of their heart attack and motor vehicle crash risks. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {"Hot on the heels of the award-winning and best selling Discovering Statistics Using SPSS Third Edition, Andy Field has teamed up with Jeremy Miles (co-author of Discovering Statistics Using SAS) to write Discovering Statistics Using R. Keeping the uniquely humorous and self-depreciating style that has made students across the world fall in love with Andy Field's books, Discovering Statistics Using R takes students on a journey of statistical discovery using the freeware R, a free, flexible and dynamically changing software tool for data analysis that is becoming increasingly popular across the social and behavioral sciences throughout the world. The journey begins by explaining basic statistical and research concepts before a guided tour of the R software environment. Next the importance of exploring and graphing data will be discovered, before moving onto statistical tests that are the foundations of the rest of the book (for e.g. correlation and regression). Readers will then stride confidently into intermediate level analyses such as ANOVA, before ending their journey with advanced techniques such as MANOVA and multilevel models. Although there is enough theory to help the reader gain the necessary conceptual understanding of what they're doing, the emphasis is on applying what's learned to playful and real-world examples that should make the experience more fun than expected."--Publisher's website.

@article{Harris2000a,
abstract = {While demonstrations of optimistic bias are plentiful, successful attempts at eliminating the bias (debiasing) are rare. The current study attempted to debias by reducing the perceived social distance between the self and the typical own university student. Using self-categorisation theory, it was predicted that rating the out-group target (the typical student at another university) before the in-group one would reduce the perceived social distance between the self and the latter and lead to a reduction in optimistic bias. Both predictions were supported, with optimistic bias being eliminated for negative events and attenuated for positive events. In the standard optimistic bias condition (in-group {\textregistered}rst) optimistic bias was obtained for both negative and positive events. The {\textregistered}ndings provide support for perceived social distance in determining optimistic bias. The implications for recent arguments that comparisons with an abstract target automatically evoke aI am better than average' heuristic or necessarily entail the use of distributional judgmental frameworks are explored. Whilst the automatic linking of abstract targets with heuristic or distributional thinking is called into question, a case is made for integrating these ideas with the self-categorisation approach. Where practitioners aim to reduce optimistic bias, the {\textregistered}ndings suggest promoting the perception of the target as a fellow in-group member may help do so.},

abstract = {A large body of research has documented a valence dependent asymmetry in belief updating. Specifically, participants update their beliefs to a greater extent when receiving desirable information compared to undesirable information. Here, we ask whether asymmetric belief updating is observed for predictions regarding everyday positive and negative life events. First, using simulations, we show that an artificial bias in updating would be observed if a skewed distribution of base rates is utilized without controlling for estimation errors. This artificial bias is flipped for positive and negative life events. We then go on to use normally distributed base rates, for which the simulation does not produce an artificial bias. Our human data reveal an optimistic update bias when predicting everyday life events and provides evidence that the pattern is similar regardless if one is estimating a positive or negative event.},
